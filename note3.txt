以后就在这里写我的技术博客吧，等技术成熟了，再将它搬
到网上去。貌似还是喜欢 Konsole 多一点。现在才真正感到了钱的作用
，钱不仅可以给我带来成就感，还可以督促我努力学习。自己挣钱的时
候才能真正理解真钱的艰辛。现在的工资太少，因为我会得太少，如果
我的技术再强一点，我就可以挣到更多的钱。所以，好好学习，认真思
考。

源码下载命令：sudo apt-get source leafpad这个命令可以下载
Leafpad 的源码。你说这个命令强大不。哈哈，果然是Unix系统的天下
啊，这一点是windows无法无论如何也没法比的啊。gdb 调试指定参数
set args < in这样就可以将in的数据导入到程序中了，记得以前这个问
题困扰了我很久，今天终于解决了。详细的调试方法可以参考这里

感冒了，还没有好。但是快好了，等会就上班去。应该就是
简单的感冒，不是肺炎。不知为什么，一直有种要被解雇的感觉。别人
发工资了，我还没有。也不知道什么时候会给我。这几天请假，让我更
虚了。似乎这工资拿得很不应该。唉，扯远了，这里是写技术的地方，
别乱发感慨。好吧，过会去上班。

setting up my own lamp system.
apache2 php5 phpmyadmin and some other software.
This site helped a lot.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP

For me , most important part is configure these softwares.
Adjust the default webpage from '/var/www' to '/home/fox/php'
This is in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file, just
modify this file.
I also installed a tomcat7 for me, and I install all docs and
examples for me, as well as a mamaner. It works well now.

you configure should be like this.
		<role rolename="tomcat"/>
		<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
		<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
		<user username="fox" password="yourpasswd" roles="tomcat,manager-gui,admin-gui"/>
save it and then restart your tomcat7. then you can access your manager and admin pages.
But now I don't know how to build a tomcat web app. This is what I should do
next.


I should know more about the service command.
How to add your script as a service.

Bad habit. Shit. My blog is so useless.

This is a blog that tells you about update-rc.d command, useful.

awk is useful, shell is powerful, you should know more about shell.
You will do things efficiently.
