I know it is hardful, but I want this way. I need to know them well.
This process is too long, but I have no choice.
remember to do `sudo make clean`
if you chaged your ./configure --with-mysql --with-gd, otherwise your compile
process will fail, know about this.
compile process is slow.

For most problems, there are detailed information in official documentation.

I know something, 
compile php with  --with-mysql, it will generate mysql-module for you.
with apache/apsx , it will load php in apache. and update the httpd.conf file
for you, and there have a http.conf.bak file left for you. yes, that's all 
happened for you.

Ok, I need to build mongo and redis for me.

build mongo.
http://www.mongodb.org/about/contributors/tutorial/build-mongodb-from-source/
I used this command: 
%  sudo apt-get build-dep mongodb  %
%  scrons all % this command will build all mongo tools.
%  scrons install --prefix=/opt/server/mongodb/  % to install mongodb in your path.

build redis.
this is easy, just make and make install
% 

the problem is , after the compilination, where is the mongo conf files.
this is not a problem, just create need path, if you want. db/, conf/, log/, that's all
then copy  this mongodb.conf from here.

and the same to redis.

对 redis 和 mongodb，编译完成只会给安装 bin 目录，里面是对应的工具。但是我们还需要一些其他的
目录还有对应的配置文件。这个目录和配置文件是可以自己创建的。所以只要变已完成，基本就算安装
完成了，在启动的，加载。
Just start your server, and load your config file, then your server should be work.
compile all your server software is not an easy thing.

Now, for my server, I need redis-php and mongo-php, with these two mod, I can build my own system.

python
sudo apt-get install pip
sudo pip install redis  pymongo  mysql-python
redis   pymongo  mysql-python

for python docs, you need to consult the pydocs for more.
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis/

That's all for my server.

git status

I find some subfiles can not be hidden.Because the subdir is a git repo.
just remove .git/ files, recommit it, and it will be ok.
